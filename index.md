# Resilience of Criminogenic systems during COVID-19

Our team support police forces in adapting their strategies during the COVID crisis. Our work is underpinned by a social-ecological resilience framework and computational tools grounded in data science. In practice, we adopt a collaborative, problem-oriented approach to generate evidence and understand:
- [x] how crime is evolving during the COVID-19 crisis,
- [x] what problem police should focus on,
- [x] where police presence should be concentrated.
